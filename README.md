# Wellness AI

This project generates synthetic wellness data for machine learning applications. The data is designed to be realistic and can be used to train models for various wellness-related tasks, such as predicting stress levels, recommending healthy habits, and identifying individuals at risk of developing chronic diseases.

## Features

*   **Realistic Data:** The data is generated based on a set of rules that are designed to mimic the real world. For example, the model takes into account factors such as age, sex, activity level, and sleep habits when generating data.
*   **Customizable:** The data generation process is highly customizable. You can specify the number of users, the amount of data to generate for each user, and the specific features to include in the data.
*   **Extensible:** The data generation code is easy to extend. You can add your own features to the data, or you can modify the existing rules to better suit your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Python installed. You can then install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can generate the data by running the `ml_wellness_project_rushit.ipynb` notebook in the `synthetic-health-data` directory.

## Usage

The generated data is saved in a CSV file. You can use this file to train your machine learning models. The data is in a tabular format, with each row representing a single day of data for a single user. The columns in the data represent the different features that were generated.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
